# What is the BrainGenDesktop?
BrainGenDesktop - desktop part of the [portable brain wave activity generator](https://github.com/lompal/BrainGenSTM32) which creates artificial raw analog brain signals.
The analysis is carried out using the TGAM1 NeuroSky module which precisely accurate with additional noise filtering collects incoming electrical signals to translate activity into desktop software which visualizing all EEG rhythms including attention and meditation meter algorithms.

# Features overview
  - MindSet Communications Protocol from June 28, 2010 support
  - Generate up to 8 different waves of brain activity (you can also form identical rhythms to amplify each other)
  - Separate configuration of amplitude and frequency values for each signal
  - Visualization settings for more accurate analysis of input data

# Features to be implemented soon
  - Signal generation scripting, which allows you to change the parameters of each signal over time
  - Export data to file
